Materials regarding decentralized AI research.



## Consensus Optimization

This includes literatures on consensus optimization (mainly from mainly control community).
Hopefully one can borrow theory from them to build fully decentralized algorithms.

## Decentralized SGD

- Can decentralized algorithms outperform centralized algorithms? a case study for decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent.

- D^2: Decentralized training over decentralized data.   
ICML 2018. Hanlin Tang, Xiangru Lian, Ming Yan, Ce Zhang, and Ji Liu. 

## Federated Learning \& Optimization

This is one recent setting proposed to solve one existing decentralized data setting, 
but the algorithms therein are still centralized algorithms. 

- Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data  
2017 AISTATS. McMahan, Brendan and Moore, Eider and Ramage, Daniel and Hampson, Seth and y Arcas, Blaise Aguera

## Mobile AI

This is one emerging setting where one wants to learn an intelligent model for mobile devices, such as
mobile phones, tablets etc.
