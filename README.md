Materials regarding decentralized AI research.



## Consensus Optimization

This includes literatures on consensus optimization (mainly from mainly control community).
Hopefully one can borrow theory from them to build fully decentralized algorithms.

- DSA: Decentralized double stochastic averaging gradient algorithm

## Federated Learning \& Optimization

This is one recent setting proposed to solve one existing decentralized data setting, 
but the algorithms therein are still centralized algorithms.
